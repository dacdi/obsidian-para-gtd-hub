# PARA Guide – My System

This note explains the basic structure of my vault and how I align Outlook & Todoist with it.  
👉 Goal: A consistent, future-proof system for Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archive.

---

## 📂 Structure

```

/Projects  → time-bound initiatives with a clear goal/end
/Areas     → ongoing responsibilities (roles, duties)
/Resources → knowledge base, templates, contacts, meetings
/Archive   → completed projects, old files

```

---

## 🔑 Rules

### Projects
- Everything with a **deadline or clear output**.  
- Examples:  
  - `KRITIS_BlackoutResilienz`  
  - `IMED_Training2025`  
  - `Teaching_NRI3.4_Environment_2025`  
- Internal structure of a project:  
```

/01\_Management
/02\_Literature
/03\_Methods / Classes
/04\_Data / Participants
/05\_Meetings
/06\_Publication
/99\_Archive

```

### Areas
- Ongoing themes/roles without a defined end.  
- Examples:  
  - `Teaching_general`  
  - `Administration_IT`  
  - `Job_Administration` (contract, hours, vacation)  
  - `IMED_Role` (annual planning, recurring tasks)  

### Resources
- Everything that is **cross-cutting** or serves as a **knowledge base**.  
- Examples:  
  - `Conferences` (lists, planning)  
  - `Contacts`  
  - `Prompt_Library`  
  - `Templates`  
  - `Meetings` (central storage, tagged e.g. #Kritis, #IMED)  

### Archive
- Final storage for completed work.  
- Whole projects or older versions.  
- Rule: while a project is ongoing → use the internal `/99_Archive` folder;  
  once completed → move the entire project folder to `/Archive`.  

---

## 📧 Outlook
- Mirrors only **Projects** and **Areas**.  
- Same names as in the vault.  
- Inbox = capture; then sort:  
  - Project email → Project folder  
  - Area-related email → Area folder  
  - Everything else → delete or archive  

---

## ✅ Todoist
- Same list as in the vault (Projects + Areas).  
- No Resources → they stay in Obsidian.  
- Archive = completed projects.  
- Labels: `@Waiting_for`, `@Meeting`, etc.  

---

## 📝 File Naming
- Meetings, tasks, versions → with date:  
  `YYYY-MM-DD_Title.md`  
- Permanent notes → title only:  
  `Contact_JanWillem_SiSKIN.md`  
- Consistently separated with `_`.  

---

## 💡 Meetings
- Always stored in `/Resources/Meetings`.  
- One file per conversation, even if multiple topics.  
- Assign with tags (#Kritis, #IMED, #Vacation).  
- In Projects/Areas, meetings are displayed via **MOCs** (Dataview queries).  

---

👉 This setup is **my master system**.  
New projects → `/Projects`.  
Ongoing responsibilities → `/Areas`.  
Knowledge → `/Resources`.  
Completed work → `/Archive`.
